Sum_up was the first group project app i did in unversity, i had had some previous expereince beforehand with the more personal projects i had done( running app, and my websites) but this would be the first introduction to both proper documentation of a commercial app as well as working as a team. i was lead programmer, overall my previous work with android studio helped tremendously when starting work on sum_up. UI and the like turned out much better than my first iterations, i got to create a much better system of user login than before by getting to grips with PHPmyadmin, as well as using more advanced calculation than before thanks to my previous work before as well as managing a database and all the issues that come with that.

in regards to documentation. i got to understand how different a real world app is than some app you create for fun/improvemement as well as a glimpse into how developers and teams work together and i am very happy with what our team managed to create
